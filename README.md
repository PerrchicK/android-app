# android-app

This is an Android app I'm developing during the [classes](https://yedion.afeka.ac.il/yedion/fireflyweb.aspx?prgname=S_LOOK_FOR_NOSE&arguments=-N50209,-A,-N1253) I'm teaching in [Afeka Academic College of Engineering, TLV](http://english.afeka.ac.il/).

It demonstrates different usages in Android development, such as:
* Intent + Activity (intent's extra, other apps' activities, phone call etc.)
* List view (using RecyclerView)
* Threads (with UI changes)
* Storage [Shared Preferences, SQLite, Firebase, custom Content Provider]
* Backendless, similar to Parse cloud service (for an online-shared-preferences) + example for A/B Testing usage
* Animations (View animations, Property animations)
* Drag n' Drop
* Bound service
* Broadcast Receiver
* Fragment
* Sensors usage + Mock Sensor
* Local scheduled notifications
* Embedded GoogleMap in a FrameLayout object + Markers
* Google APIs usage - Geolocation in JavaScript (get LatLong from an address)
